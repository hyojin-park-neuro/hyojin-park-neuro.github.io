# Under construction

[Dr Hyojin Park](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/psychology/park-hyojin.aspx) (Principal Investigator) is a [Birmingham Fellow](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/strategic-framework/Research/fellows.aspx) at the [School of Psychology](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/psychology/index.aspx) and [Centre for Human Brain Health (CHBH)](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/centre-for-human-brain-health/index.aspx) at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx), Birmingham, UK.

She completed a PhD on Cognitive Neuroscience at the Interdisciplinary Program in Cognitive Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea (PhD supervisor: Professor Dong Soo Lee, MD, PhD) and before that she completed her undergraduate degree in Psychology at the Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea.
Subsequently she worked as a Research Associate (postdoctoral researcher) in the lab of Professor [Joachim Gross](https://www.uni-muenster.de/OCCMuenster/members/joachim-gross.html) and Professor [Gregor Thut](https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/staff/gregorthut/) (supported by their Wellcome Trust Senior Investigator Award) at the School of Psychology, Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology, Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging (CCNi) at the University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.

# Research in the Group
The main goal of our research group is to understand neural oscillatory mechanism in speech processing - both auditory and visual - as well as their integration that leads to a unified perception.

**Why Rhythms in Speech?** Speech consists of a hierarchy of components occurring on different timescales. For example, prosody or intonation occurs on a relatively long timescale-hundreds of milliseconds, syllables occur on around hundred millisecond, and short transients and phonemes last only tens of milliseconds. Similarly distinct neuronal populations fire rhythmically at different rates (brain oscillations), and different bands of oscillations are arranged in a hierarchy.

**Speech Entrainment (Speech-Brain Coupling)** These brain rhythms, low-frequency oscillations in particular, are thought to establish efficient channels for communication. It's similar to tuning a radio to a certain frequency to listen to a certain radio station. We investigate how brain oscillatory activity and their multiplexed relationship track incoming speech inputs, and further proactively predict upcoming speech streams for facilitating comprehension. In the course of time, we will investigate neural oscillatory mechanisms of speech production and interpersonal communication (brain-to-brain coupling).

**Facilities and Tools** The Group is a part of the newly established Centre for Human Brain Health (CHBH) at the University of Birmingham. The Centre is equipped with state-of-the-art brain imaging facilities, e.g. MEG, OPMs, EEG, MRI, TMS, TCS, Sleep labs, fNIRS. We combine these modalities in order to obtain comprehensive picture of neural mechanisms of speech and multisensory (AV) integration.
